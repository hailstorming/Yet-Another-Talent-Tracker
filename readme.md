# Yet Another Talent Tracker
Alternatively called Yet Another Enhancement Point Tracker, but that name doesn't sound as cool in an acronym, so let's call it YATT!
Brings salvation to those of you under 500 EP by allowing you to see your daily EXP in an aesthetic (and bloated) format!


## Features

* Aesthetic EP message design that follows my "perfection is bloated" design sceme.
